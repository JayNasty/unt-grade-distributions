# UNT Grade Distributions
A search and visualization tool for grade distributions at the University of North Texas.



#TODO list: 
#	1. Move CSS to separate file to keep the HTML cleaner 
#	2. Escaped characters at the bottom of index.html 
#	3. Using bootstrap 3, possible upgrade to boostrap 4? 
#	4. Make the "Downloading data" on the real page a dropdown menu 
#	5. "Share" and the Grading system key could be improved to look better IMO 
#	6. Align "Results" and "grading system key" to match donating to the cause
