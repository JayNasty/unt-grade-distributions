#TODO list:
#       1. Escaped characters at the bottom of index.html
#       2. Using bootstrap 3, possible upgrade to boostrap 4?
#       3. Make the "Downloading data" on the real page a dropdown menu
#       4. "Share" and the Grading system key could be improved to look better IMO
#		5. Find a way to re-generate fall2017spring2018.json using the improved parse.php without compromising 'term' field
