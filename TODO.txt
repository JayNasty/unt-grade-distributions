#TODO list:
#       1. Move CSS to separate file to keep the HTML cleaner
#       2. Escaped characters at the bottom of index.html
#       3. Using bootstrap 3, possible upgrade to boostrap 4?
#       4. Make the "Downloading data" on the real page a dropdown menu
#       5. "Share" and the Grading system key could be improved to look better IMO
#       6. Align "Results" and "grading system key" to match donating to the cause. ALIGN the entire page as one, not seperately
#	7. Nuke classes with all the same grades, unuseful to end user
